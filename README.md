API with User Data
===

Build a searchable, pageable explorer for an API of your choice, that authenticates a user, allows user to select favorites, stores favorite data, and displays user favorites.

## Process Requirements

1. Commit regularly (at least every 15-20 minutes). Demonstrate your thinking through regular incremental commits. Solo builds without an incremental commit history will not pass.
2. TDD every function that does not directly manipulate the DOM; template functions, query write/read, make search api url, data transformation. If these functions are not driven by tests (demonstrated by commit history) the build will not pass.

## API

Pick an API that:

1. Has CORS enabled
2. Accepts a search/query term
3. Supports paging

You will likely need to sign up for an API key.
